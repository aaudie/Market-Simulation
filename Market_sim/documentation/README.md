## 🎓 Citation Recommendation

When referencing this work in your thesis:

```
This simulation implements a hybrid Markov regime-switching model for real estate 
market dynamics, combining empirical transition matrices from traditional and 
tokenized markets [See: documentation/04_MODEL_COMPARISON.md]. The model addresses 
key limitations in data availability through interpolation methods [See: 
documentation/01_CURRENT_LIMITATIONS.md, Section 2.1] while maintaining 
interpretability for policy analysis.
